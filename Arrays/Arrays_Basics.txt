Find the 3rd minimum and 2nd maximum element in an array

n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))[:n]
a.sort()
return a[3],a[-2]

TC- O(nlogn)

Comments :
Solution works when Kth maximum or minimum is need, where K can change. 
But if you have a fixed number you want, which is relatively small, like 3rd minimum in this case, there is a faster way for this.
Try to think of O(n) solution.



2.
Reverse the array
arr=arr[::-1]

Comments :
Good that you know Python shortcuts. Try to find out how this works internally nd how much time it takes.
Also, think of another solution, one which is language independant, i.e you can use the logic in other languages too.
It's good to know Python shorthands but you should also know alternatives.




3.
Subarray with given sum (array has only +ve numbers)
Question Explained : 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 array is given. Given sum = 12
1 2 [3 4 5] 6 7 8 
[3 4 5] subarray of the given array has sum 12.

If sum was 15 ans would be [1 2 3 4 5]
First think of a Brute Force approach, then try to optimize it.



4.
Rotate Array

a=[]
for i in range(1,len(arr)):
	a.append(arr[i])
	
a.append(arr[0])
return a

TC-O(N)	

Comments : 
Solution works, TC is correct but Space Complexity is O(n) because you are creating a new array of N size.
Can you do this in-place (making changes in the given array itself, O(1) space). Also, rorate the array by K places.




5.
Remove duplicates from sorted array

a=[]
for i in arr:
	if (i in a):
		continue
	else:
		a.append(i)
return a

TC-O(n)

Comments :
Solution works.
If I modify the question a bit.
Sorted Array is given. It's length is given as a variable. You have to remove all duplicates and return the modified array and new length.
Space Complexity should be O(1), i.e, you cant use new array, you have to make modifications in-place in the given array
(Array will be traversed till length variable, so array size can be greater than length)





6.
In a sorted and rotated array find index of kth minimum element
Explanation:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - array
7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 - rotated array
K = 3
Answer is 5 as 3rd minimum number is 3 which is present at 5th index in rotated array





7.
Given two sorted arrays, merge into third array


n=int(input())
m=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))[:n]
b=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))[:m]
c=[]
for i,j in zip(a,b):
	c.append(i)
	c.append(j)

return c

TC-O(n)

Comments :

Doesn't work. Maybe the question wasn't clear.
I expect the final array to be a sorted collection of elements from Array1 and Array 2.

Example : 
Array 1 : 4 7 9 11 15
Array 2 : 2 3 4 10 

Merged Array : 2 3 4 4 7 9 10 11 15





8.
Matrix spiral traversal

Explained : 
Given Matrix :
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16

Expected Output : 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10
